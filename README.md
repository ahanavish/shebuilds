## Problem we aim to solve

Employee retention is a major concern in the workplace. It's not only about keeping your employees happy; it's also about retaining your talent and ensuring the presence of the finest individuals on your team for the longest time possible.

One-third of new employees depart within six months, according to data. According to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, 3 to 4.5 million Americans leave their employment each month (JOLTS).

Employee turnover has been increasing in recent years, according to statistics. Employers are not only losing great talent, but they are also dealing with the challenges of hiring, training, and replacing lost staff. Finding the finest personnel often entails advertising job ads, recruiting agencies, screening, interviewing, and hiring. This amounts to a significant investment of time, money, and energy in replacing people who could have been maintained with an effective employee retention plan.

Employee retention rates of 90% or above are considered adequate, and a firm should aspire for a turnover rate of 10% or below. The greatest method to retain employees is to make them feel appreciated, provide them with training programs or mentorship opportunities that will aid in the development of new skill sets for advancement within your firm, and encourage them in communicating their ideas to management on a regular basis. Employee retention also boosts morale, lowers expenses, maintains a positive client experience, and lowers total costs.
